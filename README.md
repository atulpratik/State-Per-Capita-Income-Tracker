## State GDP Tracker
The State GDP Tracker is a project that utilizes Excel to analyze and visualize the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) for different states in India over the years. The project involves extracting raw data from the RBI website, performing data cleaning and processing tasks, and creating a map chart of India using IIP maps software.

## Data Source
The raw data for the project was obtained from the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) website. The data includes GDP figures for various states in India for multiple years.

## Data Cleaning and Processing
To prepare the data for analysis and visualization, the following steps were taken:

1. Data Cleaning: 
The raw data was examined for missing values, incomplete rows, and irrelevant columns. Necessary rows and columns were filled or removed to ensure the dataset's integrity.

2. Data Formatting: 
The format of the data was modified using Excel functions such as transpose to rearrange the data into a suitable format for analysis and visualization.

## Visualization
After the data cleaning and processing steps, the Excel sheet served as the basis for creating a map chart of India. To accomplish this, I utilized IIP maps software, which allows for the creation of interactive and visually appealing maps.

## Usage
To use this project, follow these steps:

1. Download the raw data from the RBI website or use the provided dataset.
2. Open the Excel file containing the cleaned and processed data.
3. Use the Excel functions and formulas to further analyze the data or modify it as needed.

## Dependencies
1. Microsoft Excel
2. IIP maps software
